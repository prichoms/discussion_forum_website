### Setting up NodeJS and npm on your device:

# NOTE: 
	npm comes as an annex to nodeJs, so you don't need to install it seperately.
        
	It is advisable to first check whether your system already has some version(dilipidated or new) of nodeJS.
        Currently you can use v.10 which is the stable version or you can have the beta v.12.Depends on you completely.
           
	To check the version of nodeJS on windows, type 'node -v' on command prompt.
	For Ubuntu try 'node -version' if above code does not work.

## Installation(Windows):
	
It's the easiest way to install nodeJS:
*	Surf the net for the version of nodeJS that you like.
*	Download and install it.
*	Now you have to add the path of npm in the environment variables.
*	Mostly it is C:/ProgramFiles/npm. It is however advisable to check the path of npm installation.
*	You are done.
	
# NOTE: You may face some integrity issues while using the command "npm run devStart" on windows
       possibly due to some dependency issues. It is advisable to search for the problem in stackoverflow.com and ammend it accordingly.
	

## Installation(Linux):

The key difference lies only in the way you install nodeJS.
You probably will have to use terminal for that as GUI methods are not that viable with linux installations.
However you can find extensions in the linux stores for the newer versions of Ubuntu(18.04 onwards).
The steps for going through terminal are:
*	Type 'sudo pkg install node'.
*	You may get broken packages. For that you ought to update your packages and repositories.
*	Rest will be taken care by the system(no need to add path).
 

### IMPORTANT!!: Make sure to have administrator or root privileges for doing the things. Avoiding this may create permission-denial error.
